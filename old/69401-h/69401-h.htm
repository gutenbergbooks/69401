<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_PLAY">THE STORY OF THE PLAY</h2>
</div>


<p>Santa Claus neglects his Christmas duties, for he has fallen in love
with a beautiful girl, the Queen of the Fairies. The Queen also, being
completely occupied with her consideration of Santa’s suit, neglects
her duty of seeing that the Christmas trees, holly and turkeys are made
to grow for Christmas.</p>

<p>The President of the United States sends a Messenger to find out what
is the matter, but he cannot gain audience with the Queen nor Santa.
He appeals to the Queen’s fairy attendants to help him out. So they
transform him into a Fairy Prince, and he seeks the Queen’s hand in
marriage. The Queen and the Prince are soon so much in love that the
Prince forgets to remind the Queen of her Christmas duties.</p>

<p>The little fairies are now much puzzled, but the Queen’s maids, Flossie
Fixit and the Elf Gossip, and the Fairy Messenger, Thomas Page,
undertake to solve the problem. They must not only arouse the Queen to
her responsibilities, but Santa as well.</p>

<p>They first bring Santa to see the Queen’s response to the Prince’s love
making, but when he is unhappy over it, they tell him to forget his
troubles by making other people happy. So he goes home and sets to work
properly, making toys and other gifts for Christmas.</p>

<p>Then the little folks wonder how they can get the Queen to do her
part. She has told her attendants not to interrupt her when a guest is
present except in a matter of life and death.</p>

<p>Flossie Fixit and Thomas Page get up a telegram<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> which Thomas Page
hands to the Prince. It states that his home is on fire and that his
mother will be burned up unless he makes haste to rescue her. The
Prince flies to his mother.</p>

<p>Flossie Fixit puts the Prince into a deep sleep. Gossip spreads the
report that the Prince has been burned up in the fire.</p>

<p>The Queen is so grief-stricken that they are afraid she will die, and
Billy Bundy brings Santa Claus to console her. Then her old love for
Santa returns, and she takes refuge in his comforting old arms. Finally
she says:</p>

<p>“I love you, Santa. I will marry you.”</p>

<p>So Santa Claus and the Fairy Queen are married. Santa Claus takes his
bride home and, as it is the very day before Christmas, he immediately
puts her to work making the Christmas trees, holly and turkeys grow.
By noon all is finished and Santa Claus starts off on his tour,
distributing gifts to all the little children in the world, flying
first of course to the side of the world which is dark. He tries to
get the Queen to go with him to help distribute the gifts, but she
refuses, saying she has done her part of the work. Santa tells her she
is not a very satisfactory wife for a Santa Claus. She smiles at him
reproachfully, but will not go. Santa wraps the little Queen in his
arms for a moment and then goes alone.</p>

<p>The Fairy Queen grieves, thinking Santa doesn’t love her any more, and
she says: “Oh, why did the Prince have to die?”</p>

<p>She throws herself on the couch and finally cries herself to sleep.</p>

<p>Billy Bundy, the Fairy Minister, says to Flossie Fixit: “Sister
Flossie, the Queen is very unhappy. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> <i>can</i> we do? What
<i>can</i> we do? You’ve got her married to the wrong man.”</p>

<p>“Where is the Prince?” asks Thomas Page.</p>

<p>“The Prince is asleep,” says Flossie, “but I will now awaken him.” To
this end she picks up the Queen’s wand and waves it back and forth
three times.</p>

<p>The Queen, awakening, looks through Santa’s spy glass and sees the
Prince coming back. She flies out of the door to meet him.</p>

<p>The Elf Gossip enters, announcing that the Prince has arrived and the
Queen has gone off with him. Thomas Page goes out to see what can be
done about it.</p>

<p>The Elf Gossip picks up the spy glass. Suddenly she calls Billy and
Flossie to look through the spy glass at Santa Claus on his travels.</p>

<p>He comes to an old lady all dressed in red, evidently intending to play
Santa Claus. There are a tree and stockings by the chimney which Santa
Claus comes down, and a sign: “For my long lost son.” She is alone and
weeping. Santa comforts her and then invites her to go on his trip to
act as Mrs. Santa Claus, as he needs help. She goes, and both she and
Santa think this great fun. Elf Gossip declares Santa Claus has kissed
the old lady.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Queen and Prince enter Santa’s home. The Queen says:</p>

<p>“I would get a divorce, but I just can’t think of breaking dear old
Santa’s heart. He is such a darling.”</p>

<p>Santa, who (with the old lady) has returned for more toys, enters the
door at this point, looking playfully severe; there is a twinkle in his
eye.</p>

<p>The Prince falls on his knees:</p>

<p>“Ah, forgive me for being here,” he says, “I have done the little Queen
no harm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Thomas Page enters, blowing a horn. He announces: “The Supreme Court
has ordered me to pronounce the Queen’s marriage null and void, because
any marriage is illegal which takes place between a human being and a
fairy. In the Court’s judgment, Santa Claus is human.”</p>

<p>Billy Bundy steps forward and the Prince says to the Queen: “Here is
the minister ready to marry us.”</p>

<p>The Queen says she feels she ought to transform Santa into a fairy and
marry him over again. The Prince is disconsolate.</p>

<p>Santa says: “Cheer up, Prince. I don’t want to be transformed into a
fairy. I would rather be human. I am going to give you to each other as
my Christmas gift to you.”</p>

<p>The Fairy Queen and the Prince rejoice.</p>

<p>Santa then brings in the old lady, who is immediately clasped in the
arms of the Prince. He says:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, it seems <i>so</i> good to see you.”</p>

<p>The old lady murmurs: “My long lost son!”</p>

<p>Santa Claus announces: “The Prince’s mother is going to be Mrs. Santa
Claus.”</p>

<p>Billy Bundy approaches, and the two couples place themselves before
him, one on each side, while he says: “I pronounce you husband and
wife.”</p>

<p>Curtain opens, revealing a handsome Christmas tree, with an enormous
stocking marked, “For Santa Claus,” and from it a book on which Santa
reads: “How Young Husbands Can Make Their Wives Happy.”</p>

<p>Santa is jubilant over his stocking and the book. He examines the other
gifts and distributes them.</p>

<p>Billy Bundy says: “We should not keep Santa here to distribute our
gifts. Half the little children in the world are waiting for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>The reindeer drive up to the door. Santa and Mrs. Santa drive off, Mrs.
Santa calling back: “We will bring some of the little children back
with us.”</p>

<p>All dance around the Christmas tree singing: “The Christmas Tree.”
Santa and Mrs. Santa return, with a troop of little folks from the
audience, to whom they distribute gifts. They are jovial and cordial in
their greetings, while the Fairy Queen and the Prince are gracious and
delightful. All the little fairies help, distributing the gifts among
the audience, crying: “Merry <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>Christmas!”</p>

in, Santa Claus. We are <i>very</i> glad to see you.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> How are you, Tiny Tim? May I see the
Queen?</p>

<p class="stage-left"><span class="smcap">Santa</span> <i>advances as the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>extends

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Thomas Page.</span> Oh, somebody else is coming! I wonder who
it is this time?</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Tiny Tim</span> <i>ushers in a tall, dignified young man</i>.</p>



<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Young Man</span> [<i>bows to them all</i>]. I am a messenger
from the President of the United States.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">All the Fairies.</span> Oh, Mr. Messenger, we are <i>so</i>
glad to see you. [<i>They all shake hands with him.</i>]</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Young Man.</span> What is the matter here? The little
children all over the world are wondering if Christmas is going
to be late. There are no Christmas trees growing, no holly or
turkeys.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Thomas Page.</span> Santa Claus is madly in love with
the Fairy Queen, and he and the Queen have forgotten their
Christmas duties. I propose that we break up this love affair.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy.</span> Why doesn’t your President, as Commander
in Chief of the United States Army, order troops out to bring
Santa Claus to time?</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> That’s just what I’ll ask him to do.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit.</span> Oh, don’t. He’s not really bad. I
suggest that you, Mr. Messenger, allow us to transform you into
a fairy prince, so you can win the Queen’s hand in marriage.
When Santa Claus recovers from the shock, he’ll be glad enough
to attend to his Christmas duties.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">All the Fairies.</span> Oh, how delightful!</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Why, have you no fairy princes already in
fairy land?</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Thomas Page.</span> None of them are handsome enough or big
enough to suit the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> And you think I will meet those
requirements? You really want me to stay and win the Queen’s
hand in marriage? The only problem is my poor old mother, who
lives all alone and will wonder what has become of me.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit.</span> We will look after her.</p>

the door and speaks jovially</i>]. Come, Mrs. Santa, we must
now distribute the gifts.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>sweetly</i>]. I have done my part.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> [<i>stands dumbfounded a moment</i>]. The
time is so short now. I cannot distribute all the gifts in time
without your help.</p>



<p class="stage">[<span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>is resolute and will not go</i>.]</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> [<i>starts regretfully for his sleigh. Coming
back, playfully</i>]. You are <i>not</i> a very satisfactory wife for a
Santa Claus. [<span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>looks reproachfully at him</i>.]</p>



<p class="stage"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>gathers the little</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
<i>in his arms for a moment, then exit. Enters sleigh and
reindeer prances off, bells ringing.</i></p>


<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>throwing herself upon the couch, gracefully, but
sadly</i>]. I don’t believe Santa Claus loves me any more. Oh, why did
the Prince have to die? [<i>She weeps. Presently she falls asleep.</i>]</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Billy Bundy</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Thomas Page</span>]. Step softly. The Queen is asleep.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy.</span> Sister Flossie, the Queen is very unhappy. You’ve
got her married to the wrong man. What can we do? What can we do?</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit.</span> Why, it wasn’t I who did that. It was you.</p>



<p class="stage">[<span class="smcap">Billy Bundy</span> <i>smiles in spite of himself</i>.]</p>


<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Thomas Page.</span> Tell us the truth about the Prince.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit.</span> He has been asleep. But I’ll awaken him now.
[<i>Picks up</i> <span class="smcap">Queen’s</span> <i>wand and waves it slowly back and
forth three times</i>.]</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Thomas Page.</span> Why did you not awaken him before?</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit.</span> I could not get hold of the Queen’s wand.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy</span> [<i>apprehensively</i>]. It will only make matters
worse now.</p>



<p class="stage"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>awakens</i>. <span class="smcap">Flossie</span> <i>drops wand
hurriedly</i>.</p>


<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>notices</i> <span class="smcap">Santa’s</span> <i>spy glass, picks it
up, and looks through it</i>]. Oh, the Prince is coming! Am I dreaming?
The Prince, the Prince! Oh, my beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> Prince! [<i>She drops the spy
glass, and runs out of the door to meet the</i> <span class="smcap">Prince</span>.]</p>


<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Music</span>: “<i>The Owl.</i>”</p>



<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Gossip</span> [<i>enters</i>]. Did you hear the news? The
Prince has returned, and the Queen has gone off with him.
[<span class="smcap">Flossie</span> <i>smiles</i>.]</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Flossie</span>]. I suppose
now there will be a scandal and a divorce.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit.</span> Well, we have got the Christmas things
all made, and the little children all over the world will be
happy.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Thomas Page.</span> But we must find a way to make the Fairy
Queen happy, too, or she will die, and the little children
won’t have any Christmas trees, holly or turkeys next year.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Gossip</span> [<i>playfully</i>]. Why didn’t some of you
goody, goody, wise people frame up a scheme that would have
helped the children out without making the Queen suffer?</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy.</span> We would have done so in time.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit.</span> But there wasn’t any time to lose.
You’ll see. It will come out all right.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Thomas Page.</span> I’ll have to see what can be done to
<i>make</i> it come out right. I shall see the Fairy Judge of
the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy</span> [<i>horrified</i>]. That means a divorce!</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Gossip</span> [<i>looking through spy glass</i>]. Look here,
everybody.</p>



<p class="stage"><i><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> in his travels, as seen through the

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Old Lady</span> [<i>sobs</i>]. Oh, I didn’t think you were

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> [<i>puts his arm about her</i>]. Never

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy</span> [<i>looking through the spy glass</i>].
Oh, they are having such a lovely time as they enter the
different houses and distribute the gifts! The old lady makes a
real good Mrs. Santa Claus.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit</span> [<i>looking through</i>]. They have used
up all the gifts now and are coming home for more.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Gossip</span> [<i>taking the glass and looking through</i>].
Oh, he has kissed her! Isn’t that dreadful? But I guess the
little Fairy Queen won’t care, now that the Prince has come
back.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy</span> [<i>taking the glass</i>]. Let <i>me</i>
see. I don’t believe he kissed her at all. He wouldn’t do
such a thing. It is very wrong to think bad things about
people which never happen. [<span class="smcap">Flossie</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Gossip</span> <i>laugh</i>.]</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy.</span> Hush, they have reached home.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> [<i>enters, with the</i> <span class="smcap">Old
Lady</span>]. Where is the Fairy Queen?</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Gossip.</span> The Fairy Prince has returned, and the Queen
has gone off with him.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Old Lady.</span> It’s too bad. Do you intend to get a divorce?</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> I would like to, but I am too tender-hearted.
I must protect the Queen from the scandal-mongers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Flossie Fixit</span> [<i>looking through window</i>]. Oh, the
Queen and the Prince are coming!</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Old Lady</span> [<i>looking through window</i>]. There is my
long lost son.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Let’s hide, just for fun.</p>


<p class="stage"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="smcap">Old Lady</span> <i>exit behind
curtain</i>. <span class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Prince</span> <i>enter</i>.</p>



<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Queen.</span> I would get a divorce, but I just can’t think
of breaking dear old Santa’s heart. He is such a darling!</p>


<p class="stage"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>enters at door, pretends to look very severe,
but there is a twinkle in his eye</i>.</p>



<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>falling on his knees</i>]. Oh, forgive me
for being here. I have done the little Queen no harm.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Thomas Page</span> [<i>in triumphant spirit, enters, blowing
a horn</i>]. The Supreme Court has ordered me to pronounce the
Queen’s marriage null and void, because any marriage is illegal
which takes place between a human being and a fairy. In the
court’s judgment Santa Claus is human.</p>



<p class="stage">[<span class="smcap">Billy Bundy</span> <i>steps up to the</i> <span class="smcap">Prince</span>.]</p>


<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Here is the minister ready to marry us.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Queen.</span> I believe I <i>ought</i> to transform Santa into
a fairy and marry him over again. [<span class="smcap">Prince</span> <i>shows great
disappointment</i>.]</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Cheer up, Prince. I don’t want to be transformed
into a fairy. I would rather be human. I am going to give you to each
other as my Christmas gift to you.</p>



<p class="stage">[<span class="smcap">Queen</span>, <i>kneeling, kisses</i> <span class="smcap">Santa’s</span>

<i>He bows his thanks, grinning broadly, examines other gifts
on the tree and distributes them. The</i> <span class="smcap">Fairies</span>
<i>are delighted with their gifts</i>.</p>


<p class="speech"><span class="smcap">Billy Bundy.</span> Oh, we shouldn’t keep Santa Claus here to

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
